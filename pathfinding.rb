#
# Generic pathfinding helper method.
#
# Depending on the arguments passed, this can be equivalent to
# Dijkstra's, A*, or Bellman-Ford.
#
# +neighbors+ proc must return [node,edge_cost] pairs for the given node.
#
#   # Bellman-Ford
#   pathfind(negatives: true, starts: node, neighbors: ->p{p.neighbors})
#
# Bellman-Ford works correctly in the presence of negative weights, but is slower
# than the other options and can't terminate early when the target is first found.
#
#   # Dijkstra's
#   pathfind(starts: node, neighbors: ->p{p.neighbors}, solved: ->n{n == goal_node})
#
# Faster than Bellman-Ford, but can't handle negative weights. The +solved+ proc tells
# the algorithm when to exit early because the goal node has been found. If +solved+ is nil,
# this will exhaustively solve for all nodes.
#
#   # A*
#   pathfind(starts: node, neighbors: ->p{p.neighbors},
#     solved: ->n{n == goal_node},
#     heuristic: ->n{n.distance_to_target})
#
# Can be faster than Dijkstra's with a good heuristic function. In this impl, the
# correct solution will be found even if +heuristic+ isn't admissible --
# unless you early terminate by passing in the solved argument.
#
# @returns :costs Hash<Node,Integer> The minimum cost from start to each given node.
# Note this data may be incomplete if the function exits early due to the +solved+
# argument.
# @returns :prev Hash<Node,Node> A mapping from each node => prev_node for reconstructing
# paths taken. e.g. `unfold(goal) { |node| prev[node] }.to_a.reverse` to get a path
# to goal.
