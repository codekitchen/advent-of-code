# I implemented this using Bellman-Ford's pathfinding algorithm which supports negative
# edge weights. This turned out to not be necessary since I ended up treating each
# [pos,dir,steps] tuple as a separate node in the graph anyway, and didn't end up trying to
# map it to a problem with negative edge weights.
# I'm sure it'd run some degree faster using Dijkstra's since the pqueue would help us
# find the goal faster, or A* since a good heuristic should be possible,
# but part2 completes in 25s so it's fine as is.
